<h1>
  my friend group<3
      </h1>
  hi! my name is marian hernandez and i am a person who loves and cherishes the people around me. i never really understood how people manage to only have <i>one</i> best friend, so i have <i>three of them!</i> <br>
  <br>
  so, without further ado, let me introduce you to them :) enjoy!
  
  <h2>
    leila!
  </h2>
  this is leila!<br>
  (insert image here)<br>
<br>
i met leila in a picnic before freshman year, the school arranged one for each major so we could get to know each other and not have to start from a blank page on the first day of school. we were in central park, i was wearing an anime shirt and mushroom earrings. she was <i>also</i> wearing an anime shirt, with no mushroom earrings unfortunately.<br>
  <br>
  we bonded over our similar interests, ended up getting boba together, and we've been the closst of friends ever since. i honestly don't think i would be able to function properly if i didn't know her.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>
    <b>some of my favorite things about her?</b>
  </h3>
  <li>the thing she talks about most are potatoes. for no reason at all. we even used to have a potato cult in freshman year, it somewhat died out.<br></li>
  <li>she always ALWAYYYSSS smells like vanilla. i'm going to steal her perfume one day.</li>
  <li>we're both equally as weird as one another, we match each other's energy well</li>
  <br>
  i dread the fact that we don't have as many classes together, we almost barely hang out. <i>but</i> she will always be the first real friend i made at this school, i love her like a sister.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>
    cherisse!
  </h2>
  this is cherisse!<br>
  (insert image here)<br>
  <br>
  i actually slightly knew cherisse for a both freshman and sophomore year, it was only until last year that i really got close with him. i actually got introduced to him officially by one of my best friends (who i'm actually going to be talking about next!)
