  my friend group<3
      </h1>
  hi! my name is marian hernandez and i am a person who loves and cherishes the people around me. i never really understood how people manage to only have <i>one</i> best friend, so i have <i>three of them!</i> <br>
  <br>
  so, without further ado, let me introduce you to them :) enjoy!
  
  <h2>
    leila!

  this is leila!<br>

i met leila in a picnic before freshman year, the school arranged one for each major so we could get to know each other and not have to start from a blank page on the first day of school. we were in central park, i was wearing an anime shirt and mushroom earrings. she was <i>also</i> wearing an anime shirt, with no mushroom earrings unfortunately.<br>
  <br>
  we bonded over our similar interests, ended up getting boba together, and we've been the closst of friends ever since. i honestly don't think i would be able to function properly if i didn't know her.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>
    <b>some of my favorite things about her?</b>
  </h3>
  <li>the thing she talks about most are potatoes. for no reason at all. we even used to have a potato cult in freshman year, it somewhat died out.<br></li>
  <li>she always ALWAYYYSSS smells like vanilla. i'm going to steal her perfume one day.</li>
  <li>we're both equally as weird as one another, we match each other's energy well</li>
  <br>
  i dread the fact that we don't have as many classes together, we almost barely hang out. <i>but</i> she will always be the first real friend i made at this school, i love her like a sister.<br>
  <br>

  i actually slightly knew cherisse for a both freshman and sophomore year, it was only until last year that i really got close with him. i actually got introduced to him officially by one of my best friends (who i'm actually going to be talking about next!) he's genuinely one of the funniest people i've ever encountered, anything he does or says makes me burst out into a fit of laughter that could last at least ten minutes. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>
    <b>some of my favorite things about him?</b>
  </h3>
  <li>his style is immaculate. he has an array of jeans that i <i>will</i> be stealing one day.<br></li>
  <li>his vocabulary is so distinguished it's actually hilarious. he'd use some of the most descriptive words to describe something and it's honestly both impressive and funny. he reminds me so much of the nerd emoji in the most endearing way possible.<br></li>
  <li>he's very mature when it comes to certain situations. yes, he'll make a joke here and there, but he always keeps it real and comes up with the most realistic outcomes in any type of problem. he also has a way of comforting that could make anyone feel better.</li>
  <br>
  i'm always so upset about the topic of hanging out because we NEVER DO. but it's not his fault, so i can't be that upset. but the day we all have a sleepover is the day i'll truly be fulfilled in my life.

  <br>
  my GAWD. when i say that this girl is my twin flame and my soulmate i mean it. i didn't get close with idalis until LAST SUMMER. can you believe it? before that we've just seen each other in the hall, we also had lunch together during eighth period in freshman year. that was until the summer before sophomore year we both went to a summer program called SAI (Summer Arts Institute) for vocal singing. we became sort of friends and would only ask each other if we were going back to SAI the following summer. <br>
  <br>
  so, the summer before junior year we went and we became closer than ever. we hung out a lot, we sung together, and i even met her family. that summer has so many stories that i could make a <i>book</i> out of. but i love her nonetheless, she's my icon and my non-blood related sister. my mom even wants to adopt her. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>
    <b>some of my favorite things about her?</b>
  </h3>
  <li>SHE HAS SIMILAR HAIR TO ME! everyone always tells me that we look like we could be sisters or cousins. not too long ago we had a sleepover at my place where we did out hair together. it was heart wearming for me because i've actually never done that with a friend before. it made me feel a little better about the hassle and hard work of having my hair type.<br></li>
  <li>she can match my energy so. well. she can tell when i'm sad, happy, frustrated, etc. it's like she can read my mind and i can read hers.<br></li>
  <li>i love her family (minus her brother, but thats a different story). her mother is so sweet and funny, and her dad is very nice too! her mom makes some of the best food ever and they're very welcoming whenever i come over. whenever we're on facetime, sometimes her mom comes in and asks me when i'm going to come over again.<br></li>
  <br>
  fortunately, her dad works a ten minute drive from me, so she comes over almost all of the time. she practically lives in my house at this point. but it's nice since i'm an only child and she sometimes gets tired of her brother.
  <br>

  <br>
  <b>so!</b> that was my <i>very</i> long introduction to my friend group! i hope you stayed to read the whole thing and maybe learned a thing or two about my friends. if you come across them, say hi! they're super nice and kind-hearted. i'm very grateful to be friends with all three of them and i wouldn't ask for another friend group. i'm sad we don't get to spend more time together because of my <i>gosh darn Into The Woods rehearsals</i>, but hanging out with them in school is always fun too!!<br>
  <br>
  thank you for reading! love you, xo.<br>
